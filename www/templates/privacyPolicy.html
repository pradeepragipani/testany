	<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>



	<li>

	We collect and use your information below to provide our Services and to measure and improve them over time.

	</li>



	<li>

	<b>Basic Account Information: </b> When you create or reconfigure an account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, email address, or phone number. On the anyhap Services, your name and username may be listed publicly, including on your profile page and in search results, and you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. Some anyhap Services do not require registration.

	</li>



	<li>

	<b>Contact Information: </b>You may use your contact information, such as your email address or phone number, to customize your account or enable Services, for example, for login verification. If you provide anyhap with your phone number, you agree to receive text messages to that number from anyhap. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services, to market to you, to help prevent spam, fraud, or abuse. You may use your settings for email and mobile notifications to control notifications you receive from the anyhap Services.

	</li>



	<li>

	<b>Additional Information: </b> You may provide us with profile information to make public on the anyhap Services, such as a short biography, your location, your website, date of birth, or a picture. If you provide us with profile information and you don’t see a visibility setting, that information is public.  If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request.

	</li>



	<li>

	<b>Haps and other Public Information: </b> Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information with the world. Most of the information you provide us through the anyhap Services is information you are asking us to make public. Your public information includes the messages you Hap; the metadata provided with Haps, such as when you Happed and the client application you used to Hap; the language and time zone associated with your account; and the lists you create, people you follow, Haps you mark as likes and many other bits of information that result from your use of the anyhap Services. We may use this information to make inferences, like what topics you may be interested in, and to customize the content we show you, including ads. Our default is to make the information you provide through the anyhap Services public for as long as you do not delete it. The anyhap Services broadly and instantly disseminate your public information to a wide range of users, customers, and services. For instance, your public user profile information and public Haps may immediately be delivered via our APIs to our partners and other third parties, including search engines, developers, and publishers that integrate anyhap content into their services, and institutions such as universities and public health agencies that analyze the information for trends and insights. When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.
